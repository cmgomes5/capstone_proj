# Virtual DM

A companion tool for DMs who like to play in person, 
but hate managing turn order on pencil and paper.

# Running Locally

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Docker
- Taskfile

If you are using a Mac environment you can install these
dependencies using Homebrew and the command `brew bundle`

## Running

To run for local development you can use `task run-dev`

For a proper build of the Docker container you can use `task docker-run`

If you want to avoid installing Docker and Task you can use `npm run dev`
or `npm build && npm run start`
